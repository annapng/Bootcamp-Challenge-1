# Horiseon Social Solution Services - Bootcamp Challenge #1


## Description

This first Challenge Assignment given by the DU Full Stack Bootcamp shows off my newfound abilities of being able to fix various issues within a given set of code. I solved some broken links as well as organized and commented on the code, to make it more easily navigatable to newcomers. The most valuable lessons I've learned on this project were the deeper dives into Git and Github - of how to get a new directory started in my computer as well as troubleshooting various Github deployment issues. 

Overall, I believe this was a successful project on my end.
